# 0ad-maps

These maps are derived from existing skirmish maps from the [0 A.D.
project](https://play0ad.com/). For additional information regarding
licensing, see the [0 A.D. Project
Overview](https://play0ad.com/game-info/project-overview/).

This repository is not endorsed or maintained by anyone from the
0 A.D. development team.

The human players' bases are very close together and the maps may not
be balanced enough for PVP games.

The maps can be accessed by using the "andjam" filter at the game setup
menu.
