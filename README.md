0 A.D. Skirmish maps

These maps are derived from existing skirmish maps or randomly
generated maps from the [0 A.D. project](https://play0ad.com/). For
additional information regarding licensing, see the [0 A.D. Project
Overview](https://play0ad.com/game-info/project-overview/).

This repository is not endorsed or maintained by anyone from the
0 A.D. development team.

These maps are primarily made for playing against the AI. The human
players' bases are very close together and may not be balanced enough
for PVP games.
