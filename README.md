# 0ad-maps

These maps are derived from existing skirmish maps or randomly
generated maps from the [0 A.D. project](https://play0ad.com/). For
additional information regarding licensing, see the [0 A.D. Project
Overview](https://play0ad.com/game-info/project-overview/).

This repository is not endorsed or maintained by anyone from the
0 A.D. development team.

The human players' bases are very close together and the maps may not
be balanced enough for PVP games.
